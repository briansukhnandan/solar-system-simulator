## Solar System Simulator
A remake of one of my old projects, revamped with React + Three Fiber.
Context is a lot of my old students used this as an educational tool, however they would have to setup an HTTP server to run it. The main motivation here is for anyone to be able to access this.

## How to use
- `Left-Click + Drag` - Rotate
- `Right-Click + Drag` - Pan
- `Scrolling` - Zoom
